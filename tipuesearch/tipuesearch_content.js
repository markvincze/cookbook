Mix pork and beef in a large bowl; season generously with salt and pepper, then mix again.\nForm into about 18 large meatballs. Step 2 Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Working in 2 batches, cook meatballs, turning occasionally and reducing heat if bottom of pot looks in danger of scorching, until browned all over, about 6 minutes per batch. Step 3 Reduce heat to medium. Add pancetta and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes.\nAdd onion, celery, carrot, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6\u20138 minutes.\nAdd tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until paste darkens, about 2 minutes.\nAdd wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until nearly completely evaporated, 4\u20135 minutes.\nAdd tomatoes, crushing with your hands, and increase heat to medium-high.\nCook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is jammy and reduced by about half, 8\u201310 minutes.\nAdd broth and milk and return meat to pot.\nBring to a simmer. Cover pot, leaving lid slightly ajar, and transfer to oven. Bake sauce (no need to stir, but check after 1\u20132 hours to ensure liquid is at a low simmer, adjusting oven temperature as needed) until meatballs are falling-apart tender, 3\u20134 hours. Step 4 Using a potato masher, break meatballs apart and incorporate into liquid (you should have about 8 cups rag\u00f9); season with salt and pepper. Reduce over medium-low heat if needed to thicken. Do Ahead: Sauce can be made 4 days ahead; let cool, then cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.

Transfer to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and use within 1 hour or chill. Do Ahead: B\u00e9chamel can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Rewarm just enough to loosen before using. ASSEMBLY Step 6 Preheat oven to 170\u00b0 C. Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally and separating noodles so they don\u2019t stick to each other, until just starting to soften but still snap in half rather than bend when folded; 3 minutes is the magic number. They will be so firm it will just seem all wrong, but this is what separates al dente lasagna layers from gummy ones. Transfer noodles to a large bowl of cold water to cool. Drain and lie flat in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet, separated by parchment or wax paper. Step 7 Lightly oil a 33x22cm glass or ceramic baking dish. Spread 1\u00bd cups rag\u00f9 in dish. Lay a single layer of noodles over rag\u00f9 (you will need to cut some noodles in half in order to fill all gaps). Spoon 1\u00bc cups b\u00e9chamel over noodles, spreading in an even layer with a small offset spatula. Top b\u00e9chamel with 1\u00bd cups rag\u00f9. Repeat, creating 5 layers of pasta (or 6, depending on how deep your pan is) and ending with remaining 1 cup b\u00e9chamel. It should come right to the top edge of the dish, and the top layer of pasta will get super crunchy when baked. Step 8 Cover with a lightly oiled piece of foil and set on a rimmed baking sheet (just to catch drips). Bake lasagna until bubbling gently around the edges, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and increase oven temperature to 220\u00b0 C; carefully place rack in top of oven. Uncover and continue to bake until top is browned and crisp around the edges, 10\u201315 minutes.

Quickly smash butter into flour mixture with your fingers, working until the largest pieces are about the size of a pea. Gradually stream 1 cup cream into bowl, tossing flour mixture constantly with a fork to distribute. Using a flexible bench scraper or a hard plastic spatula, fold dough over and onto itself several times, scraping bottom and sides of the bowl, to bring together into a mass (dough will feel very wet and sticky). Turn out dough onto a generously floured surface. Pat into a \u00be\"-thick rectangle or square with floured hands, using bench scraper or spatula to lift up dough and dust underneath with more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Dust surface with more flour, then cut dough into 4 equal pieces and stack on top of each other. Dust with flour and press down on stack with a rolling pin to flatten to a workable height. Roll out to \u00bd\" thick, dusting with more flour as needed. Use cutter to punch out biscuits as closely as possible, dipping cutter in flour often. Transfer biscuits to a plate. You should have about 30. Gather up dough scraps, reroll, and punch out more biscuits if needed. Chill until ready to use.
