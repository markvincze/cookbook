# Ingredients

 - Butter, for greasing the pan
 - 4 large eggs, separated, at room temperature
 - ½ cup/100 grams granulated sugar
 - 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
 - 1⅔ cups/400 grams whole-milk Greek yogurt
 - 1 lemon, zested and juiced
 - Pinch of salt (optional)

# Recipe

**Step 1**  
Heat oven to 350 degrees and butter an 8- or 9-inch springform pan.

**Step 2**  
Using an electric hand mixer or a standing electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites on medium-low until the mixture looks frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly start to increase the speed to medium-high. Continue to beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Set aside.

**Step 3**  
In a separate bowl but using the same mixer, combine yolks and sugar (no need to wash beaters after the egg white). Beat yolks on medium-high until the mixture is very pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and gradually beat in flour, yogurt, lemon zest and juice, and salt until fully incorporated.

**Step 4**  
Gently fold half of the egg whites into the yolk-yogurt mixture until only a few streaks remain. Fold in the remaining whites, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl, until the batter is evenly mixed, light and smooth.

**Step 5**  
Scrape the batter into prepared pan and smooth into an even layer. Bake until the top is speckled with golden brown and puffed, 40 to 55 minutes. (The 8-inch pan will take longer to bake through.) Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cake cool before cutting. Serve warm or cold.
