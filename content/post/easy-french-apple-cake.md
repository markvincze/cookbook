# Ingredients

 - 1 cup (130g) all-purpose flour
 - 1 teaspoon baking powder
 - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
 - 2 large eggs, room temperature
 - 100g granulated sugar (this is the correct amount, halved from the original recipe)
 - 2 tablespoons rum
 - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
 - 10 tablespoons (141g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature
 - 5 to 6 medium apples (about 2 pounds), peeled, cored, and diced into 1/2-inch cubes
 - Confectioners sugar, for dusting, optional

# Recipe

Preheat oven to 350°F.  
Grease and line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper.  
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.  
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, rum, and vanilla extract.  
Add half of the dry ingredients to the egg mixture and whisk to combine. Add the melted butter and whisk to combine. Add the remaining dry ingredients and whisk until just a few streaks of flour remain.  
Gently fold the apples into the batter just until combined. Spread the batter into the lined pan and smooth the top with an offset spatula.  
Bake until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted in the center of the pan comes out clean, about 1 hour. The cake will be very moist.  
Transfer the pan to a wire rack. Allow to cool, then sprinkle with confectioner’s sugar, if desired.  
This cake is very moist, so it will keep at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. The cake can also be wrapped and frozen for up to 3 months.
