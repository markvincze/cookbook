## Ingredients

 - 350 grams bread flour (preferably organic) 
 - 90 grams whole wheat flour (preferably organic and stone-ground) 
 - 350 grams 90°F/32°C filtered water 
 - 90 grams ripe sourdough starter (100% hydration) 
 - 9 grams kosher salt or fine sea salt 
 - white rice flour, for dusting

## Example schedule

### Day one

 - 8:30 AM – autolyse (mix flours and water). allow mixture to rest, covered, at 80°F/26°C for 1 hour, or as long as 2 hours. 
 - 9:30 AM – add mature sourdough starter, mix thoroughly. cover and rest at 80°F/26°C for 30 minutes.
 - 10:00 AM – add salt and mix thoroughly. cover and rest at 80°F/26°C for 15 minutes.
 - 10:15 AM – 10:45 AM – stretch and folds #1, #2, #3 (every 15 minutes). cover and rest at 80°F/26°C between each set. 
 - 11:15 AM – 12:15 PM – stretch and folds #4, #5, #6 (every 30 minutes). cover and rest at 80°F/26°C between each set. 
 - 12:15 PM – 2:15/3:15 PM – allow dough to rest, covered, at 80°F/26°C for the rest of the bulk fermentation period. this period will range from 1.5 – 2 hours (or much longer), depending on ambient temperature, starter strength, and flour variety. Generally, I like to end bulk fermentation when the dough is just under double in size. This has produced good results for me and this guideline works well for this specific sourdough process and timeline. 
 - 2:15/3:15 PM – pre-shape. leave uncovered at room temperature for 20 minutes.
 - 2:35/3:35 PM – final shape. transfer to rice floured banneton basket, cover with a plastic bag, and seal. allow to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before transferring to the fridge.
 - 3:45 PM – 7:45 AM  – retard dough (final proof) in refrigerator at 38°F/3°C for 16-17 hours. 

### Day two

 - 6:45 AM – preheat Challenger Pan, Dutch Oven, or combo cooker in 500°F/260°C oven for at least 1 hour. 
 - 7:45 AM – remove dough from the fridge, transfer to preheated pan, score, and bake at 500°F/260°C with the lid on for 25 minutes. 
 - 8:10 AM – remove pan lid, reduce oven temperature to 475°F/245°C and bake uncovered for about 20 minutes or until deeply caramelized. allow loaf to cool completely – this will take several hours – before slicing and serving.
