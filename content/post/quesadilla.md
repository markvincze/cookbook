# Ingredients

- 1 red capsicum (bell pepper), diced
- 1 large red onion, diced
- 1-2 jalapeños, diced
- salt, to taste
- olive oil
- 1 tbsp Tajín chilli powder
- 2 tbsp cumin
- 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, diced
- 1 lime
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- ½ tbsp coriander powder
- 500g (about 1.1 lbs) grated cheese (a mix of mozzarella, Red Leicester, and Gouda is recommended)
- 8 large flour tortillas

# Recipe

1. In a bowl, combine the capsicum, red onion, and jalapeño. Season with salt, 1 tablespoon of Tajín, 1 tablespoon of cumin, and approximately 1½ tablespoons of olive oil. Mix well and set aside.
2. In a separate bowl, add the chicken, juice of one lime, garlic powder, smoked paprika, coriander powder, remaining cumin, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Mix well and set aside.
3. Heat a flat-top grill or large cast-iron pan over high heat, drizzle with some more olive oil, and add the seasoned vegetables. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the vegetables start to colour and are cooked through but still crisp. Remove from the grill and set aside.
4. On the same grill, cook the chicken for 7-8 minutes, or until fully cooked through.
5. Clean the grill well and reduce the heat to low. Place one tortilla on the grill, sprinkle generously with cheese, then add some of the vegetable mix and some chicken. Once the cheese begins to melt, fold the tortilla in half and grill on both sides until golden brown and the cheese is nicely melted.
6. Cut into four pieces and serve immediately, optionally with some salsa on the side.
