# Recipe

## CAESAR DRESSING

### Step 1

Chop together 6 anchovy fillets packed in oil, drained, 1 small garlic clove, and a pinch of kosher salt. Use the side of a knife blade to mash into an anchovy paste, then scrape into a medium bowl. Whisk in 2 large egg yolks, 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, and ¾ tsp. Dijon mustard. Adding drop by drop to start, gradually whisk in 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, then ½ cup vegetable oil; whisk until dressing is thick and glossy. Whisk in 3 Tbsp. finely grated Parmesan. Season with salt, freshly ground pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.

Do ahead: Dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Store in an airtight container and chill.

## CROUTONS

### Step 2

Preheat oven to 375°. Toss 3 cups torn 1" pieces country bread, with crusts, with 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil on a baking sheet; season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden, 10–15 minutes.

Do ahead: Croutons can be made 2 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room

## ASSEMBLY

### Step 3

Place 3 romaine hearts, leaves separated (for the ideal mix of crispness, surface area, and structure), in a large bowl. Use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount of Parmesan (a mound of grated Parmesan may look impressive, but all that clumpy cheese mutes the dressing) on a plate. Use your hands to gently toss together the lettuce, croutons, and dressing. Top with the shaved parm.
