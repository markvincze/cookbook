 - Pan size: 22cmx32cm
 - 425g flour
 - 8g baker's yeast. (1⅛  tsp active dry yeast)
 - Pinch of sugar
 - 0.5 tbsp kosher salt
 - 2.5 tbsp olive oil

Combine flour with 1¼ cups room-temperature water, mix until incorporated and shaggy. Cover.

Stir yeast, sugar, and ¼ cup warm water in a small bowl. Let sit until yeast is foamy, about 5 minutes.

Pour yeast mixture into dough, mix on low speed until incorporated (~1 minute). Add salt, keep mixing until elastic and sticky (~5 minutes)

Pour 3 Tbsp. oil into a large bowl and swirl to coat sides. Scrape in dough with a large spatula or flexible bench scraper. Cover and place in a warm spot until dough is doubled in volume, 2–3 hours.

Drizzle 2 Tbsp. oil over a 22cmx32cm sheet pan and use fingertips to rub all over bottom and sides. With a bench scraper, fold dough inside the bowl a couple of times to deflate, then scrape onto prepared baking sheet. Using oiled hands, lift up dough and fold over onto itself in half, then rotate baking sheet 90° and fold in half again. Cover dough with a piece of well-oiled plastic and let rest 10 minutes to let gluten relax.

Uncover and go back in with oiled hands, gently stretching dough (to avoid tearing) across length and width of baking sheet in an even layer, working all the way to edges and into corners. If dough starts to spring back, let sit 5–10 minutes and start again. Cover again with same piece of oiled plastic and chill at least 8 hours and up to 24.

Let sheet pan sit in a warm spot until dough is puffed and bubbly and nearly doubled in height, 45–65 minutes. Meanwhile, place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 450° F (230° C).

Remove plastic and drizzle dough generously with more oil. Oil hands again and press fingertips firmly into dough, pushing down all the way to bottom of pan to dimple all over. Sprinkle generously with sea salt.

Bake focaccia until surface is deep golden brown all over, 25–35 minutes. Let cool in pan 10 minutes. Slide a thin metal spatula underneath focaccia to loosen from sheet pan (it may stick in a couple of places, so use some elbow grease to get underneath) and transfer to a wire rack. Let cool completely before cutting as desired.
