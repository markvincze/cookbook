## Ingredients

### Biscuits

 - 35g granulated sugar
 - 3/4 Tbsp. baking powder
 - 1.5 tsp. finely grated lemon zest
 - 3/4 tsp. kosher salt
 - 1.5 cups (200g) all-purpose flour, plus more for surface
 - 85g chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces
 - 1 cup chilled heavy cream

### Filling and Assembly

 - 650g fresh (or frozen) sweet cherries, pitted
 - 75g granulated sugar
 - 50 ml fresh lemon juice
 - 2 Tbsp. cornstarch
 - 1/3 tsp. ground cinnamon
 - 3/4 tsp. vanilla extract
 - 1/5 tsp. almond extract
 - 1/5 tsp. kosher salt
 - 2.2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled
 - 1.5 Tbsp. raw sugar
 - Vanilla ice cream or softly whipped cream (for serving)

## Preparation

### Biscuits

Whisk 35g granulated sugar, 1.5 tbsp baking powder, 1.5 tsp lemon zest, 1.5 tsp salt, and 200g cups flour in a medium bowl.
Add 85g butter and toss to coat. Quickly smash butter into flour mixture with your fingers, working until the largest pieces are about the size of a pea.

Gradually stream 1 cup cream into bowl, tossing flour mixture constantly with a fork to distribute. Using a flexible bench scraper or a hard plastic spatula, fold dough over and onto itself several times, scraping bottom and sides of the bowl, to bring together into a mass (dough will feel very wet and sticky).

Turn out dough onto a generously floured surface. Pat into a ¾"-thick rectangle or square with floured hands, using bench scraper or spatula to lift up dough and dust underneath with more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Dust surface with more flour, then cut dough into 4 equal pieces and stack on top of each other. Dust with flour and press down on stack with a rolling pin to flatten to a workable height. Roll out to ½" thick, dusting with more flour as needed.

Use cutter to punch out biscuits as closely as possible, dipping cutter in flour often. Transfer biscuits to a plate. You should have about 30. Gather up dough scraps, reroll, and punch out more biscuits if needed. Chill until ready to use.

### Filling and Assembly

Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 200°. Mix cherries, 75g granulated sugar, 50ml lemon juice, 2 tbsp cornstarch, 1/3 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp vanilla extract, 1/5 tsp almond extract, and 1/5 tsp salt in a large bowl. Scrape filling into a 2-qt. baking dish or 9"-diameter cake pan with 2" sides and press down on it firmly to compact. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet.

Arrange chilled biscuits over filling, fitting snugly so they’re touching with only a few gaps. Brush generously with butter; sprinkle with raw sugar.

Bake cobbler 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 180° and continue to bake until biscuits are golden brown and juices are bubbling, 50–65 minutes more. Let cool slightly. Serve cobbler with ice cream.
